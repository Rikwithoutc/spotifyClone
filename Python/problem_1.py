""" 
You are given a table with 
 rows and 
 columns. Each cell is colored with white or black. Considering the shapes created by black cells, what is the maximum border of these shapes? Border of a shape means the maximum number of consecutive black cells in any row or column without any white cell in between.

A shape is a set of connected cells. Two cells are connected if they share an edge. Note that no shape has a hole in it.
